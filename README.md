# 2019 NYC AirBnb Market EDA

In this notebook, I take a look at the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.



I will be working with three datasets:

"datasets/airbnb_price.csv"
"datasets/airbnb_room_type.xlsx"
"datasets/airbnb_last_review.tsv"


This is to demonstrate converting untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions. In the case of this notebook:

What was the average price, per night, in 2019 of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How did the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts were for private rooms?
How did Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
